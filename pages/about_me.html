            <p>
              Born and raised in Panama with Italian roots, Carolina Jaen has
              developed a great passion for visual arts and in particular for
              painting inspired by her career as an architect and interior
              designer. <br />
              <br />
              Very visible in her works are all the characteristics of a vast
              visual language linked to a harmonious palette of colors and
              natural forms. There is a clear visual reference to balance and
              equilibrium in every work as the result of compelling observation
              and her individual taste for art. The projection of space and
              boundaries is a clear evolution from her educational formation as
              well as hands on experience she has gathered. Inside the works,
              there are all the different characteristics that relate to the
              many factors that can determine a visual space. It’s a knowledge
              derive from the consolation she has achieve during her career.
              <br />
              <br />
              Being the daughter of an artist and a well-travelled person, has
              helped enhanced her vision to identify all the archetypes that are
              present in the Mediterranean and modern culture. It might be her
              Italian origins that make these element feather accentuated, as
              well as the natural surroundings in her hometown Panama City, a
              modern urban scene immersed in the tropical forest. These
              contrasting factors offer an infinite reference in forms of
              vegetations and the postmodern architecture. <br />
              <br />
              Her work breathes this synthesis of styles in every canvas making
              it as unique as universal reference which are on display in every
              original work related to the natural meaning of a pure spirit of
              gratitude and simplicity. It’s perhaps the result that comes of an
              education in Europe and the Americas. Defining a postmodern vision
              whose origin are always embedded in the primordial aspects of a
              sincere art.
